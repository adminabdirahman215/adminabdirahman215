Summary 
Mrs. Pumphrey was a rich and emotional lady who has a cute pet called Tricky. She loved him so much that she 
overfed him. Tricki had put on a lot of weight which made him lethargic. When doctor Herriot saw the fat dog like 
a bloated sausage he was shocked. He made a plan and told Mrs. Pumphrey that Tricki needed treatment for a 
ailment which was possible only in hospital. The doctor knew that Mrs. Pumphrey would not be able to keep the 
dog on a proper diet. When the greedy dog went to the hospital he had to remain hungry if he was slow to approach 
for food. He was given food at fixed intervals. Soon he shed off a lot of his body weight and became quite active. 
When Tricki was at home he was pampered by Mrs. Pumphrey. He had a luxurious life when he was served with 
cream cake chocolate and horlicks. But when he came to the doctor he became all right. When Mrs. Pumphrey saw 
her active dog she thanked the doctor and felt that it was a triumph of surgery.
